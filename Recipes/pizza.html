                <h2>Preparation Method for the Dough</h2>  
                <p>
                1. In a bowl, mix the yeast cubes with the sugar.</br>  
                2. Add the egg, milk, and olive oil, then mix well.</br>  
                3. Gradually add the wheat flour.</br>  
                4. Finally, add the salt and mix until a homogeneous dough forms, slightly detaching from your hands.</br>  
                5. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rise for about 30 minutes or until it doubles in volume.</br>  
                6. Roll out 2 medium-thickness discs using a rolling pin on a floured surface, folding the edges to form the crust.</br>  
                7. Place the dough on a 35 cm diameter baking tray greased with olive oil and pre-bake for 8 minutes in a preheated oven at 180¬∞C.</br>  
                8. Finally, add the desired topping and return it to the oven to heat.</p>
